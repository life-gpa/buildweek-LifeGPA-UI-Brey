                        <p class="what-p">LifeGPA takes all of your life's most important tasks, and summarizes them into one simple grade. We differ from all of
                        the other 'tracking-apps' in one way. We give you one overall grade, rather than measuring progress in multile areas. The grading scale
                        works just like your high school GPA. A 4.0 means you are crushing your tasks and goals. A 1.0 means you need to step it up! You can track any task or habit
                        you want inside of LifeGPA! Professional goals, personal development, fitness, and relationships are a great place to start grading yourself!
                        Do you have something specific you want to track? No problem! You can enter any task you'd like to grade yourself on and let LifeGPA do the rest!</p>

                        <p class="works-title">How LifeGPA Works</p>
                        <p class="works-p">In order to use LifeGPA, all you need to do is enter your information, and then enter the tasks you want to track.
                        Simply enter each task you perform each day before you go to bed. LifeGPA will keep track of how many times you perform each task over a 30, 60, and 90
                        day period. It will average each habit, and then average all of your habits together for you life's GPA!</p>
