                <p class="how-it-works">LifeGPA takes all of your life's most important tasks, and summarizes them into one simple grade. We differ from all of
                the other 'tracking-apps' in one way. We give you one overall grade, rather than measuring progress in multile areas. The grading scale
                works just like your high school GPA. A 4.0 means you are crushing your tasks and goals. A 1.0 means you need to step it up! You can track any task or habit
                you want inside of LifeGPA! Professional goals, personal development, fitness, and relationships are a great place to start grading yourself!
                Do you have something specific you want to track? No problem! You can enter any task you'd like to grade yourself on and let LifeGPA do the rest!</p>
