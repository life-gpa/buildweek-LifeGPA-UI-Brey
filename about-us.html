                <h2>Meet LifeGPA_Squad!</h2>
                <p class="team">LifeGPA_Squad is a team made up of 6 Lambda School Students. The team consists of 3 UI Web Developers,
                     2 Front-End Developers, and 1 Back-End Developer. We are all part-time students in three different 
                     cohorts.</p> 
                <p class="school">Lambda School is a coding school that prepares students to become software developers.
                     Lambda is revolutionizing the entire education system by making it more accesible to anyone. You can attend Lambda school with no upfront costs!
                      You only pay Lambda when you secure a job in the industry making at least $50k/year. As part-time students,
                       we attend Lambda for 18 months, 5 nights a week for 3 hours per night. We have live lectures, multiple projects 
                       a week, and bi-weekly tests. Lambda seems too good to be true, but take it from us: It's the best decision we've ever made!</p>
